# 🧪 Hi there, I'm Akintunde Idris Ayomide! 

### *Chemical Engineer by Degree. Software Engineer by Design.*

I’m a **400L Chemical & Polymer Engineering student at LASU**, which means I know how to optimize industrial processes *and* React components. I treat code like a chemical reaction: if you mix the right inputs (logic + creativity) with the right catalyst (AI), you get an explosive output 💥.

### 🧠 The "Polymath" Philosophy
I don't fit in a box. I'm not just a frontend dev; I'm a **builder**. 

I believe in **"Vibecoding"**—using AI not just to write code, but to accelerate my learning loop. I use LLMs as my pair programmers to ship faster, break things smarter, and turn complex engineering problems into clean UI.

* **My Superpower:** Breaking down complex systems (whether molecules or DOM trees).
* **My Fuel:** Solving problems that actually matter.
* **My Vibe:** Fast, efficient, and slightly obsessed with optimization.

### 🛠️ The Lab (Current Builds)

I’m constantly cooking up something new. Here is what is currently on the burner:

* **⚡ SideNote:** A browser extension I built because switching tabs to save text snippets is inefficient. It manages your digital "scrap paper" directly in the browser.
* **💊 Contra:** A medical safety app concept I'm brainstorming. It checks for food-drug interactions because staying alive should be user-friendly.
* **🛒 eStore:** A full-stack e-commerce architecture. I'm stress-testing Next.js to see how robust we can make the shopping experience.

### 🎯 The "100 Hackathons" Quest
I have a crazy goal: **I want to participate in 100 Hackathons.** Why? Because pressure makes diamonds (and really good code). I want to meet every builder in Lagos, solve 100 different problems, and maybe sleep eventually. If you see me at a hackathon, come say hi!

### 💻 Tech & Tools
* **Core:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript.
* **Style:** Tailwind CSS (because life is too short for vanilla CSS).
* **The Secret Sauce:** AI-Assisted Development & Engineering First Principles.

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I can calculate the thermodynamics of a reaction *and* fix a hydration error in Next.js. I'm still figuring out which one gives me a bigger headache. 🤷‍♂️
